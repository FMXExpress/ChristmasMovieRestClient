# ChristmasMovieRestClient
Christmas Movie REST Client based on the OMDb API built in Delphi FireMonkey.

It is quick and easy to build a REST client with Delphi. I wanted to build out a Christmas themed project in Delphi and what better way than to build a Christmas Movie finder app. I wanted to build this app so that it was cross platform and would run on Android, iOS, macOS, and Windows with a single code base and single UI so I picked FireMonkey to do this. I also wanted to built the app in a low code way so I utilized LiveBindings a bit to do this where it was appropriate. Full source code is linked at the end of the article. For this app I discovered the Open Movie Database (OMDb) which has a REST API. The OMDb has two endpoints. One end point is a search of the database and the second endpoint allows you to load data about a specific movie. I used the REST Debugger that is built into Delphi to test out each endpoint and then to generate all of the components needed to access and consume the two OMDb REST endpoints.
